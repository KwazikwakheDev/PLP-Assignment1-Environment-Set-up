#Environment Set up
This is assignment one of week two which deals with setting up the environment.
The first task was to select the preferred the Operating system(OS) and i selected the windows operating system which is windows 11.
My preffered IDE which is the integrated development  environment I selected to work with visual studio code.
I installed git and configured it using the commands git config --global user.email and git config --global user.name, these two commands are used to integrate github and git.

Open gitbash
create a new directory with mkdir "name of directory" after navigate to that directory using cd "created directory"
and then create a remote repostory with same name as the directory on Github
afterwards git nit and the git add .
and then git commit -m"Initial commit"
run the git remote add origin "url" from the github repository you created
and then git push -us origin master
to track chnages we use git status.

I then downloaded python and installed afterwards navigated to vs code to install the packages. Pip was already installed and i installed maplotlib using the git bash. and also on vs code on explorer i installed maplotib and also code runner and Prettier these are some of the extensions that i installed on vs code. installed python and dart on vs code

I havent confiured MySQL because I am not really familiar with it.

Challenges faced wash to initialize the repository on my local machine and how to get to github
